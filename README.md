The scene is booming! We accept everyone, provided the MVP already gone life in the net.

# How to Submit

To submit a site suggestion, open an issue or create a pull request. Pull requests will be given higher priority since they are easier to include. Make sure the screenshot is at least **1000x800** and please double check that everything looks good before submitting.

Itâ€™s also a good idea to run the screenshot through an image optimizer like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) before including it. This will help keep the website fast and the repository small as possible.
